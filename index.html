            Unordinary follows a boy named John who just transferred into Wellston High School. 
            John is your ordinary who lives a pretty normal life, except he doesn't have an ability
            of his own. In John's world, your ability defines who you are. The better your ability,
            the stronger you are. The weaker you are, the rougher your life is. As for John, he finds 
            himself fending for every second of his life. This all changes when he meets Serapina, 
            Wellston's strongest student.
